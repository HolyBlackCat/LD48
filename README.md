### imp-re engine

A relatively simple game engine written for personal purposes.

Libraries used:

* SDL2 for window management,

* OpenGL for graphics,

* OpenAL for audio.

* FMT for text formatting.

The engine comes comes with custom macro-based relfection, custom JSON parser and several other features.

It's licensed under **ZLIB license**. Feel free to use it.

Currently I'm targeting Clang 10.0.0 (with GCC 10's libstdc++). GCC 10 may or may not work with minor adjustments. MSVC .
