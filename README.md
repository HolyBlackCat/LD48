### imp-re engine

It's a relatively simple C++ engine for personal purposes.

Libraries used:

* SDL2 for window management,

* OpenGL for graphics,

* OpenAL for audio.

* FMT for text formatting.

The engine comes comes with custom macro-based relfection, custom JSON parser and several other features.

It's licensed under **ZLIB license**. Feel free to use it.

Currently we're targeting Clang 9.0.0. GCC 9.x and Clang 8.0.x should also work. MSVC is not supported.
